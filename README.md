## Knowledge4COVID-19 Framework
Knowledge4COVID-19 is a framework that aims to showcase the power of integrating disparate sources of knowledge to discover adverse drug effects caused by drug-drug interactions among COVID-19 treatments and pre-existing condition drugs. The Knowledge4COVID-19 framework is devised as a network of data ecosystems (DEs). It aligns [data](https://tib.eu/cloud/s/DqBEep8R9bAj4EK) and metadata to describe the network and its components. Heterogeneity issues across the different data sets are overcome by various methods of data curation and integration. Each DE comprises data sets, programs for accessing, managing, and analysing their data. Interoperability issues across a DE data sets are solved in a [unified view](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/blob/main/KGC-DIS/K4Covid-19UnifiedSchema.ttl). [Mappings](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/tree/main/KGC-DIS/CSV2RDF-RMLMappingRules) between the data sets and the unified schema describe the meaning of the data sets.

## Knowledge4COVID-19 DataEcosystem
Data sources from the data sources in the Knowledg4COVID-19 DE are integrated into the Knowledg4COVID-19 KG. The following figure depicts the steps of the KG creation process. Steps 1 and 2 are done at the level of Scientific Open Data and Publications DEs, while steps 3 and 4 are conducted Knowledg4COVID-19 DE. First, data is ingested and described in terms of metadata, e.g., title and abstract of the publications. Knowledge extraction methods (e.g., entity recognition and linking) extract biomedical entities from textual data and link the recognized entities to terms in biomedical vocabularies (e.g., [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html)) and resources in [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/), [Bio2RDF](https://bio2rdf.org/), and [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/). A total of 3,822,265 annotations have been extracted. There are 7,344 and 11,292 links to DBpedia and Bio2RDF. Also, there are 11,292 external links to DrugBank. Data integration relies on mapping-driven algorithms guided by RML triples maps that describe entities in the data sources using a unified schema. Annotations and links extracted by the knowledge extraction tools are used for solving entity alignment, i.e., they enable the identification of entities in different vocabularies and external KGs. [SDM-RDFizer](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/SDM-RDFizer) transforms the data sets into an [RDF graph](https://labs.tib.eu/sdm/covid19kg/sparql) by executing the [RML mapping rules](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/tree/main/KGC-DIS/CSV2RDF-RMLMappingRules). SDM-RDFizer implements optimized data structures that are exploited during the execution of RML mapping rules. These techniques have been empirically studied in diverse benchmarks. The observed results suggest that SDM-RDFizer can speed up the transformation of structured data into RDF in at least one order of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art RML engines. Lastly, various techniques are offered to traverse the Knowledg4COVID-19 KG and to predict drug-drug interactions.

## Knowledge4COVID-19 Evaluation
We illustrate the analytical support provided by Knowledge4COVID-19. We analyze relevant adverse effects that may be produced as a result of interactions among drugs to treat COVID-19 and the most common pre-existing conditions. The following figure depicts the adverse effects commonly reported during the treatments of hypertension, asthma, and diabetes: 

![AdverseEffect](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/blob/main/images/adverseEffectPerComorbidity.png "AdverseEffect")

A wide range of adverse effects may be triggered, but the top-5 most frequent affect the blood counts (e.g., Agranulocytosis, Eosinophilia, Pyuria, and Aplastic anemia), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., Thrombophlebitis and Hypotension), skim and hair problems (e.g., Alopecia, Pruritus, Exanthema), eye conditions (e.g., Glaucoma), and autoimmune disorders (e.g., Hypersensitivity). These adverse effects may be worsened during a SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus, patients with suffering from these pre-existing conditions should be carefully treated. 
Additionally, we evaluate the effects of the interactions (DDIs) between the drugs used to treat hypertension and COVID-19:
![Hypertensive](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/blob/main/images/Hypertensive.png "Hypertensive")

As observed, a large number of DDIs may exist and generate serious conditions like QT prolongation. They results suggest that COVID-19 patients receiving treatments for pre-existing conditions need to be carefully treated. A more detailed analysis of the impact of the combination of drugs can be executed on the public available Jupyter Notebook\furl{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/146-oQTxDpZQoOifKY6iafaEwuupH7q3t#scrollTo=ZMmLkkoE9XO0}. Also, exemplar DDIs represented in the Knowledge4COVID-19 KG can also be visualized\furl{https://youtu.be/7YsTYJzRfR0}.
